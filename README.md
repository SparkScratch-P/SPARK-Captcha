## Features:
 
 - SPARK Captcha has modern Anti-AI features to protect data.
 - It offers Audio captcha for the visually Impaired.
 - Recognisable figures are away from standard ones.
 - Audio tests 10 dictation numbers one by one.
 - Audio inputs are to be extered, each followed by a 'Submit' tick, or Enter key, which is difficult for AI.
 - Every attempt to pass it has to recognise 2 numbers each.
 - Developers need not touch the code of the Captcha to enable it on their sites! (Code Free Implementation)

## Developers:

 It is very easy to implement the captcha in your site!
 
 Remember, you just have to follow the directory system as we say. Follow the given steps ahead:
 
 - The referral page directory, which will lead to the protected content should be introduced with the following sub directory configuration: `./c/h/index.html`.
 - Now, come back to this repository and download the code from [Github Coadload](https://codeload.github.com/SparkScratch-P/SPARK-Captcha/zip/refs/heads/main).
 - Open the directory , `./c` and move all contents of it to your directory of same name, including `./c/assets`, but not `./c/h`. 
 - Now, in `./c/h/`, upload your code, with `index.html` as your main display page.
 - One more thing you can do to make it full-proof ; make the HTML page referral sensitive, like , the page will load only when it is opened from `https//:mydomain.com/c/h`, else it would return to `./c/` for the CATPCHA. *If it is possible with HTML< developers are welcome to fork, and add! We would be thankful and glad to add the contribution.`*
